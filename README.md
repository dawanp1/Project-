# Project- Hello I am new to programming and would like a bit of help
# So Technically this contruct.py program runs but not the way i wold like it
# I am having trouble getting the lines of code to print the user's inputted values
#into a list. Im not even sure if the values are being stored properly.
#I expect the program to return ""Using a for loop"" followed by the user's 
#numeric list. Then below that i would expect the statement ""Using a while loop""
#followed by the user's numeric list.

#any help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks
